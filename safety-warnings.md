# Safety Warnings

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using Safety beams, the doorway must be clear of all obstructions and persons at all times. The location of the beams and manner in which they are installed might not give safety protection at all times.

The sensors need to be 100mm above the floor level, however, the exact position must be chosen in such a manner that it suits the application, the environmental conditions and provides maximum safety protection.

When using auto close mode, a Safety beam must be fitted correctly and tested for operation at regular intervals. Extreme caution is recommended when using auto close mode. All safety rules must be followed.

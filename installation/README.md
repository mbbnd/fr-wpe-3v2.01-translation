# Installation

The Safety Beam Kit provides additional safety by preventing the shutter closing when the beam is blocked by a car, child etc.

The transmitter and receiver need to be placed in line of sight, with the beam 100mm above the ground level (as per AS/NZS 60335-2-95:2020). This can be achieved by ensuring the bottom of the receiver and transmitter are 65mm above ground level. They should also be placed as close as possible to the door opening with the receiver (RX) in shade and the transmitter (TX) in sun or shade.

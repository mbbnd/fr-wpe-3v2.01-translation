# Align Transmitter & Receiver

**Step 1:** Power the opener on. Door position is not set yet.

**Step 2:** LEDs will flicker on ALL parts, to indicate successful Bluetooth connection. Flickering stops after 30 seconds.

**Step 3:** Check alignment status.

When the Receiver's Red LED is on, the beam is correctly aligned.

When the Receiver's RED LED is off, the beam is not correctly aligned.

**Step 4:** Align Transmitter and Receiver

During the alignment process, the opener's beam alignment feature provides a guide by means of its main light (the courtesy light) and beeper.

To align the safety beam, loosen wing nut at the rear of either transmitter or receiver unit and adjust until the opener signals alignment (see above).

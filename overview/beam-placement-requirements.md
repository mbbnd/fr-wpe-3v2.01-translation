# Beam Placement Requirements

The transmitter and receiver must be placed in line of sight of each other in order to function.

It's a requirement of Australia/ New Zealand Standard 60335-2-95:2020, that the beam must be placed 100mm above ground level. This can be achieved by ensuring the bottom of the receiver and transmitter units are 65mm above ground level. \
\
They should also be placed as close as possible to the door opening with the receiver (RX) in shade and the transmitter (TX) in sun or shade.
